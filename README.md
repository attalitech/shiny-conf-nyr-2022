# Shiny Workshop - New York R Conference 2022

In this workshop, we'll be using [data](https://www.kaggle.com/schmadam97/nba-regular-season-stats-20182019) from the NBA 2018/19 season to explore the stats of NBA players with the help of a Shiny app. The final app we'll be building is [here](https://daattali.com/shiny/nba2018/) ([mirror](https://daattali.shinyapps.io/nba2018/)). We'll also use the built-in `mtcars` and {ggplot2}'s `diamonds` datasets for many learning exercises.

Slides are available [here](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-conf-nyr-2022/raw/master/2022%20NYR%20shiny%20workshop.pdf)
