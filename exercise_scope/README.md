1. What error will running the app using the "Run app" button or with the `runApp()` function yield? How would you resolve this error? Hint: The pipe operator (`%>%`) is part of the {magrittr} package.

2. Without running the app, predict in what order the timestamps will show up. 

3. If you were to open the app in a new tab, which timestamps will be different?

4. Suppose you deploy this app and share the URL with a friend, and they immediately visit it on their own computer. Which timestamps will be different than what you see on your screen?
