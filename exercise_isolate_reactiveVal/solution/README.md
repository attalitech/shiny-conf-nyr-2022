A: The observer no longer takes a dependency on input$num, so it would never fire beyond the initial time. The value would never update, so every time the button is pressed, the initial value (10) would be printed

B: Nothing, no reactive values are being accessed in that line

C: The observer no longer takes a dependency on the button, so the value would only get printed when it changes, but not when the button is pressed

D: The observer no longer depends on the value, so it will only print the updated value when the button is pressed
